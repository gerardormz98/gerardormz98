## Hi there 👋 My name is Gerardo Ramírez

I'm a .NET/React software developer with +4 years of experience. Thanks for visiting my profile!

## Take a look at some of my projects! 📖

These are some personal projects I have been working in my free time:

- [**Postboy**](https://postboy.herokuapp.com/): Online REST API Client. Made in React. Based on the core functionality of Postman, but in the web.
- [**Receipts CRUD**](https://receipts-crud.herokuapp.com/): Simple CRUD app. Made in React in the frontend and .NET Core in the backend. It includes Firebase Authentication, user roles and permissions.

_More coming soon..._

## What I'm currently working on... 💻

- 🎹 **Virtual Piano**: Web piano, made in React, p5.js and Tone.js. Just for fun!
- 📘 **Personal Portfolio**: I'm designing and building from zero my own web professional portfolio.

## What I would like to learn... ✏️
